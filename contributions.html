      <h3 class="subsection">Contributions in Computer Science and Women in STEM</h3>
      <p class="bio-text">In my journey through the field of computer science, I have actively contributed to the advancement of technology and 
        the empowerment of women in STEM in Kenya.</p>
      <p class="bio-text">As a passionate technologist, I have dedicated myself to staying at the forefront of emerging technologies.
       Through personal projects, I have developed innovative software solutions that address real-world challenges and 
       demonstrate the potential of technology in improving lives.</p>
      <p class="bio-text">In addition to my technical contributions, I have actively promoted diversity and inclusion in the field of computer science, 
        particularly in supporting and inspiring women in STEM. I have volunteered as a mentor in various programs 
        aimed at encouraging young girls to pursue careers in technology, providing guidance and support to help them overcome barriers and 
         excel in their studies.</p>
      <p class="bio-text">Furthermore, I have collaborated with local organizations and initiatives to organize workshops, seminars, and 
        networking events that foster a supportive environment for women in STEM. Through these efforts, I have helped create platforms where women can connect, 
        learn from industry experts, and gain the confidence to pursue their passions in the tech industry.</p>
      <p class="bio-text">I firmly believe that by empowering women and promoting diversity in STEM, we can drive innovation and create a more inclusive future. 
        It is my ongoing commitment to contribute to this important cause and inspire the next generation of female technologists in Kenya.</p>
